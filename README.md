# BaseProofs: The Public Ledger of Human Word

BaseProofs is a decentralized protocol for enshrining promises and proofs on the Base blockchain. Every commitment is cryptographically hashed and forever anchored to the ledger.

## Features

- **Immutable Proofs**: Once anchored, your word is permanent.
- **On-Chain Verification**: Verify any proof hash directly on the Base protocol.
- **Privacy First**: Optional anonymous enshrinement.

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set your `VITE_AI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`
